# Deep Learning Challenge - ENS ChallengeData Platform

## Challenge: **Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation by Raidium**

This repository contains our submission for the [Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Challenge](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/165/), organized as part of the *Sciences des Données* course at Collège de France, chaired by [Stéphane Mallat](https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/chaire/stephane-mallat-sciences-des-donnees-chaire-statutaire). This project is undertaken as part of the IASD curriculum at Université Paris Dauphine-PSL.

## Team Members
- **Alexandros Kouvatseas**
- **Elhadi Chiter**

## Project Overview
The challenge focuses on weakly supervised semantic segmentation, where the goal is to segment objects in images using limited annotations. We developed a deep learning-based approach leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms to improve segmentation quality while maintaining efficiency.
